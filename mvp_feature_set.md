DietLLM MVP Feature Set
Overview
The DietLLM MVP is a web-based application that leverages an LLM to help users create and modify personalized diet plans based on their goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, general health). The website features a three-column layout: user settings on the left, meal plans in the center, and LLM chat interaction on the right. The feature set is streamlined for rapid development and testing.
Target Users

Individuals seeking personalized diet plans.
Users with goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or improved health.
Tech-savvy early adopters comfortable with a web interface.

Development Timeline

Target: 3-5 days for MVP implementation.
Focus on minimal viable features to validate the concept.

Feature Set
1. User Settings Input

Description: Users input personal information to personalize their diet plan.
Details:
Fields: Age, gender, weight, height, activity level (sedentary, moderate, active), dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), and diet goal (weight loss, muscle gain, general health).
Form with dropdowns and text fields, displayed in the left column of the website.
"Submit" button to generate or update the diet plan.


LLM Integration: None at this stage; data stored for LLM use in diet generation.
Priority: High (core requirement for personalization).

2. Diet Plan Generation

Description: Users receive a personalized daily diet plan displayed in the center column.
Details:
LLM generates a daily meal plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) with portion sizes and calorie estimates.
Plan includes macronutrient breakdown (protein, carbs, fats) tailored to the goal.
Output displayed as a structured list with meal names, ingredients, and basic preparation instructions in the center column.


LLM Integration:
Prompt LLM with user settings data and goal to generate a diet plan.
Example prompt: "Create a daily meal plan for a 30-year-old male, 180 lbs, moderately active, aiming for weight loss, vegetarian, no allergies."


Priority: High (core value proposition).

3. Diet Plan Modification via LLM Chat

Description: Users interact with the LLM through a chat interface in the right column to modify their diet plan.
Details:
Chat interface with a text input box for requests (e.g., "Replace lunch with a low-carb option" or "Add more protein to breakfast").
LLM processes the request and updates the diet plan, refreshing the center column with changes highlighted (e.g., new meal in bold).
Chat history displayed above the input box for context.


LLM Integration:
LLM interprets user chat input and modifies the existing plan while maintaining alignment with the goal.
Example prompt: "Modify the lunch in this diet plan [plan details] to be low-carb while keeping it vegetarian."


Priority: High (enables iterative personalization).

4. Website Interface with Three-Column Layout

Description: A responsive, user-friendly website with a three-column layout for settings, meals, and LLM chat.
Details:
Left Column: User settings form (sticky, always visible).
Center Column: Diet plan display with meal details (scrollable if needed).
Right Column: LLM chat interface with input box and chat history.
Built using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for rapid development.
Responsive design for desktop and mobile (mobile stacks columns vertically).


LLM Integration: Interface sends user inputs (settings and chat) to the LLM via an API and displays responses in the center and right columns.
Priority: High (required for user interaction).

Non-Features (Out of Scope for MVP)

Feedback loop for diet plans (removed from original feature set).
Advanced nutritional analysis (e.g., micronutrients, glycemic index).
Integration with wearables or food tracking apps.
User authentication or data persistence beyond a session.
Complex meal prep instructions or recipe databases.
Multi-day or weekly meal planning (MVP focuses on a single day).

Technical Considerations

Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS for rapid development and responsive layout.
Backend: Minimal backend (e.g., Node.js or Python Flask) to handle API calls to the LLM.
LLM: Use xAI's Grok API (if available) or a similar LLM service for diet plan generation and modification.
Data Storage: In-memory storage for MVP (no database to reduce complexity).
Deployment: Host on a simple platform like Vercel or Netlify for quick setup.

Tech Stack & Deployment Decisions

- **LLM API Integration:**
  - Backend will act as a proxy to the LLM provider (OpenAI or Grok), with provider selection controlled by an environment variable (e.g., `LLM_PROVIDER`).
  - LLM call logic will be abstracted for easy switching or addition of providers.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express (recommended) for rapid setup and easy deployment.
  - Python with Flask or FastAPI as alternatives if preferred.
  - In-memory storage for session data (no database for MVP).
  - Hosting: Vercel (preferred for Node.js/Express), Render.com, or Heroku as alternatives.

- **Frontend:**
  - Angular (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS for rapid development and responsive layout.
  - Hosting: Vercel or Netlify (optimized for static sites and serverless functions).

- **Authentication:**
  - No authentication for MVP (no user accounts or persistent data).
  - If needed later, consider Auth0, Clerk.dev, or NextAuth.js (if using Next.js).

- **Summary Table:**

  | Layer      | Tech Choice        | Hosting         |
  |------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
  | Frontend   | Angular + Tailwind CSS           | Vercel, Netlify |
  | Backend    | Node.js + Express                | Vercel, Render  |
  | LLM API    | OpenAI (switchable to Grok)      | N/A             |
  | Auth       | None for MVP                     | N/A            |

- **Next Steps:**
  - Scaffold backend with `/api/generate` endpoint that routes to OpenAI or Grok based on env variable.
  - Scaffold frontend with three-column layout using Angular.
  - Deploy both to Vercel for fastest setup (supports both frontend and backend in one repo).

Risks and Mitigations

Risk: LLM generates inconsistent or inappropriate diet plans.
Mitigation: Use structured prompts and validate outputs (e.g., check for calorie ranges).


Risk: Limited development time for three-column layout.
Mitigation: Use Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and pre-built responsive utilities.


Risk: User chat inputs are ambiguous.
Mitigation: Provide example prompts in the chat interface and validate LLM responses.
